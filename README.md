# Learning Projects for Machine Learning

### Goals:
1. Learn how to do an ML algorithm using libraries for efficiency and future use
2. Implement the ML algorithm from scratch for learning purposes

### Currently Implemented Algos:

1. Linear Regression -> Scipy & From Scratch
2. Multiple Linear Regression -> scikit-learn & From Scratch
3. Logistic Regression -> Currently Working On
